					<p>Since graduating from Loughborough University in 2021 I have worked at IDIADA Automotive UK as a
						software engineer. At IDIADA I have worked on two main types of projects: Industry research and
						development projects that are more creative and skill based, and customer focussed work that is
						more about problem solving, meeting targets and results orientated.</p>
					<p>---</p>
					<p>In customer facing work (which is private) I have mainly worked in embedded software development
						and testing for ECUs. This has involved requirements derivation (from customer functional
						expectations), code writing, HIL testing, and finally committing the finished work back to the
						development trunk for the customer. Managing customer expectations, workloads with Jira, and
						version management with SVN are some of the transferable, soft skills I have picked up with this
						work, whilst improving my embedded C programming ability and ability to write thorough unit
						tests. </p>
					<p>Being able to develop both core and optional fucntionality, configure low-level driver
						communication, debug by stepping through the Assembly code, verifying the functionality against
						safety requirements were key skills that I learned whilst working on this project.</p>
					<p>---</p>
					<p>In the R&D work I have worked on a few different cybersecurity projects that vary in scope and
						involvement.</p>
					<p>The first is the <a href="https://autocheri.tech/">AutoCHERI project</a>. Here we worked with a
						software development firm and University researchers to test and validate new ARM cybersecure
						hardware in automotive use cases. Designing the use case architecture, preparing the scenario
						software, integrating with the ARM CHERI hardware, and executing the validation tests were the
						key parts of this 12-month project. I was a key contributor into the integration of the ARM
						hardware with the vehicle, designing the use cases, and the validation tests that were performed
						at the Millbrook testing track.</p>

					<p>---</p>
					<p>The second is the <a href="https://eratosthenes-project.eu/">ERATOSTHENES horizon 2020
							project</a>. I was involved at IDIADA as an end-user partner for this large scale, 42-month,
						inter-European project. Similar to the AutoCHERI project we were validating and testing in
						specific automotive V2X scenarios, but in this case, we were testing trust-based IOT framework
						architecture. Working with internal cybersecuirty sofware engineers based in Barcelona, and in
						conjunction with the large project consortium, I helped deliver use case definitions, module
						integration onto vehicle hardware, and a thorough evaluation of the project software solution.
					</p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="Media/eratos5.jpg"
							alt="Presenting to the European Commission at IDIADA HQ" /></span>
					<p>The project was a success, the European Commission praised it for being such a well structured
						and impresssive project that achieved all of it's goals.</p>
					<p>Personally, I gained experience in working in a large, dispersed project group, managing work
						schedules, deliverable writing, CI/CD development, containerisation, cybersecurity, advanced
						driver assistance systems and complex system architectures.</p>
					<p>---</p>
					<p>The third project is an internal R&D project focussed on Software Defined Vehicle development.
						For this project I have become even more familiar with GitLab pipeline workflows and developing
						a SDV platform. I have needed to create a Scenario for the CARLA simulator to verify the
						developed SDV and sophisticated perception interface.</p>
					<p>The Fourth project is another European-scope research project which has begun inlate 2025. It is
						a continuation of the <a href="https://synergies-ccam.eu/">SYNERGIES project</a> and involves
						scenario based ADAS validation and caetgorisation.</p>
