Growing up in Norfolk I learned to sail from a young age and was part of the Norfolk Punt Club for a number of years. I have participated in the punt class world championships a few times and occasional smaller dinghy races.

When I started at Loughborough University I found the Ultimate Frisbee club. I have played since then for University and Club teams around the UK, competing at tournaments at the national and international level.

In 2023 I joined the London-based mixed team, Deep Space, and won the UK National Championship and the European Championship in Wroclaw. Again, in 2024 we won the UK National Championship and the European Championship in Brussels.
