# Coaching

I have spent a few years coaching/ helping coach various University and club teams. I have been lucky enough to be coached by good coaches, that I have noticed some things from. I have also been at the recieving end of some poor coaching. 

I'm pretty sure I am not a good coach, in the way that I convey ideas and inspire players but I think I can make some points on good coaching principles.

## Role / Tasks


## Cmmunication


## Playbook

It is key to get a structural playbook out early, even if it means it is bare-bones and aded to througout thr season.

Having a 'Bible' that players and coaches can come back to and refer to when discussing tactics and structures helps the entire club.

Example Playbooks from University level team(s) ina  powerpoint format are [here](resources/Indoors.pptx) and [also here](resources/Outdoors_WIP.pptx).
