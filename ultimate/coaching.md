# Coaching

I have spent a few years coaching/ helping coach various University and club teams. I have been lucky enough to be coached by good coaches, that I have noticed some things from. I have also been at the recieving end of some poor coaching. 

I'm pertty sure I am not a good coach, in the way that I convey ideas and inspire players but I think I can make some points on good coaching principles.
