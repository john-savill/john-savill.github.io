# Club/ Team Management and Structure

Club management and structure will vary wildly from club to club. Whether it is a University team, a high level club team, a National team, a small local club or a city-wide large club.

All clubs will need some level or organistaion. Having an organised mangement will vastly improve the performance of a club.

A breakdown of roles at a club, what tasks they are expected to handle. How those tasks are to be handled are described after.

### Roles

| Role | Description | Tasks |
|-|-|-|
| Chair | Head of the club | executive decisions, task delegation, club overview |
| *Vice-Chair* | Assisting with club management | meeting organising, general organisation |

*Some roles won't be needed for all clubs*

Having multiple roles to organise a club are a benfit in the following ways:
 1. task delegation: Having people that can be assigned tasks means that no individual person has to be in control of everything. Having regular meetings/ communications to ensure everyone knows decisions are important here. Being able to take a step back and focus on tasks relevant to a specific role is key for an efficient working environment.
 2. input of ideas: Having multiple members for tasks will help share different perspectives.
 3. workload management: Individual committee roles can delegate tasks to others if required and won't have to know the full scope of everything the club does, in every detail.
 4. interfacing: Instead of having a committee "blob", players will find it easier going to a specific person with questions, concerns or feedback. Otherwise communications and input will get lost and ignored.

A club doesn't need some elaborate JIRA board for managing tasks and delegating jobs but some committee level management will make a club vastly more efficient.
