# Club/ Team Management and Structure

Club management and structure will vary wildly from club to club. Whether it is a University team, a high level club team, a National team, a small local club or a city-wide large club.

All clubs will need some level or organistaion. Having an organised mangement will vastly improve the performance of a club.

A breakdown of roles at a club, what tasks they are expected to handle. How those tasks are to be handled are described after.

### Roles

| Role | Description | Tasks |
|-|-|-|
| Chair | Head of the club | executive decisions, task delegation, club overview |
| *Vice-Chair* | Assisting with club management | meeting organising, general organisation |
| Treasurer | Finances | Deals with Club fees and tournament paying, equipment buying |
| Coach(es) | Club/Team coach | Trainings, tactical decsisions|
| *Assistant Coach* | Assisting the coach | Organising, running drills |
| *Personal Development Coach* | Skills and player coach | Player feedback, skills development advice |
| Captain(s) | Captaining the team | Game management, tournament management, player management |
| *Misc. Sec* | Miscellaneous seceratry roles | Publicity/ Social / Diversity + inclusion/ Wellfare |

*Some roles won't be needed for all clubs*

Having multiple roles to organise a club are a benfit in the following ways:
 1. task delegation: Having people that can be assigned tasks means that no individual person has to be in control of everything. Having regular meetings/ communications to ensure everyone knows decisions are important here. Being able to take a step back and focus on tasks relevant to a specific role is key for an efficient working environment.
 2. input of ideas: Having multiple members for tasks will help share different perspectives.
 3. workload management: Individual committee roles can delegate tasks to others if required and won't have to know the full scope of everything the club does, in every detail.
 4. interfacing: Instead of having a committee "blob", players will find it easier going to a specific person with questions, concerns or feedback. Otherwise communications and input will get lost and ignored.

A club doesn't need some elaborate JIRA board for managing tasks and delegating jobs but some committee level management will make a club vastly more efficient.

### Communication

Communication is key between a leadership group and the club itself. 

The leadership team must make sure they are able to efficiently communicate together. Anytime an issue is raised or a task needs to be completed there needs to be an understanding who is going to take the task and some sort of documented trail what has happened. 

Relaying important information to the club/team should happen often. E-mail works best for general notifications as it can be easily searched through and doesn't require learning/loading different apps. Useful for overall monthly communication 

Apps like spond/discord or anything similar are useful for making threads for individual tranings/topics and subdividing groups for more specific information.


### Feedback, using the team

It can vary from club to team but it is very likely that the overall experience outside of the core leadership team will outweigh the experience in the team, sometimes by up to 5x more. 

For this reason feedback should be a two-way flow of information.

General, informal feedback for the club/ team can be shared at trainings. This should be non-specific to a single person and team-wide.

Small, actionable feedback should be provided to individual players during trainings/ in-between games at tournaments. It has to be tangible, qunatifiable.

Club coaches/ captains and designated leadership should keep detailed notes for feedback for individual players. Preferably the feedback should be actionable, something to work on outside of trainings, and just a few key notes at a time. It helps to frame the feedback constructively, encouraging good aspects and suggesting alternatives for negative aspects of a players game/ training/ mentality. Complement sandwich.
