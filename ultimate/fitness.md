# Fitness and Nutrition

## ___I am not a fitness instructor or nutritionist___

I've just noticed that many players (even up to the higher level) can be ignorant of proper fitness regimes and nutrition plans and benefits.

I don't know that much about either but I've found some useul information and can share useful tools for tracking.

The overall point of this section is that having a general idea on what you should be aiming to do in the gym, at what point in the season, and what you should be putting into your body at different times around games/ tournaments is as important as any other aspect of a players game.

### Gym plan

Each player person is unique but having an idea of what need to trained out-of-season, pre-season, and in-season is key. 

This example gym plan and example use is something I have used and can attest to.
