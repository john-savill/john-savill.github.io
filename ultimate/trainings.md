# Trainings

There are was to maximise your trainings to get the most out of them. You can have the best players and the best strategies but to get the most out of trainings, implment strategies, and get the most out of players some extensive prepartion and planning is required.


## Training Plans

If you prepare and release training plans prior to running them it gives a lot more time for actual learning. Important questions can be raised and feedback can be gained earlier. It means learning can happen through reading then understanding the principles, visually with diagrams and demonstrations, auditorily when quickly explaining the points, and kinesthetically during run-throughs. 

When trying to get new/ complex points across this is key.

## Example Training Plans

These [training plans](resources/Trainings/) were written in 20204/5 for the Cambrige University mixed Ultimate team. They were used to try and develop a wide range of strcutures and skills in the limited number of trainigs that were alocated in their term times. There are parts that might still be useful for other developing University/ club teams.

The template for the layout of the training plans I have stolen from the Deep Space club mixed coach in 2024.
