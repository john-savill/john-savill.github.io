### Introductory Ramble

I've recently reached a decade playing Ultimate, training Ultimate, getting coached Ultimate, coaching Ultimate, wathcing Ultimate, reading Ultimate and generally participating in sport.

I wanted to note down some of my thoughts and observations to help others.

One of the key things I will talk about is accountability and self-reflection. On that topic I am fully aware I am not a great coach or great ultiamte player. I am not right about most things and I certainly have limitations. None of these thoughts should be taken as me critcising clubs, players, playstyles, and structures or trying to say that a way of doing something is completely wrong. 

Any notes or thoughts here are purely my opinion. They are simly just notes and thoughts, that at the very least might help to know what not to do.

I try to cover a wide range of topics with some expertise and and explanation but I will mostly just speak on what I know.

And, it should be obvious, but this has been written in Markdown with no spell checking, so the formatting will be basic and the spelling will likely be incorrect at times.
